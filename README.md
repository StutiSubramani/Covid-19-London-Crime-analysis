# London Crime Analysis: Impact of COVID-19

## Project Overview

This project investigates the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on crime patterns in London, focusing on how different types of crimes fluctuated during lockdowns and restrictive measures. By analyzing crime data across various periods (pre-pandemic, pandemic, post-pandemic), this study sheds light on the broader social effects of the pandemic and provides insights for future policy considerations.

## Objectives

Examine how crime rates evolved during the pandemic.
Identify crime categories most affected by lockdowns and restrictions.
Analyze the geographic and demographic variations in crime trends.
Provide data-driven insights to inform future policy and social interventions.

## Methods

#### Time Series Analysis:
Segmentation of crime data into pre-, during-, and post-pandemic phases.
Seasonal decomposition and trend identification using moving averages.
#### Lockdown Impact:
Interrupted Time Series Analysis (ITSA) to assess immediate effects of lockdowns on crime.
Comparison of full lockdowns vs. partial restrictions on crime categories.
#### Statistical Modeling:
Autocorrelation analysis (ACF/PACF) and ARIMA models for crime trend forecasting.
#### Geospatial Analysis:
Crime rate mapping to highlight geographic variations.
Spatial correlation using Moranâ€™s I and LISA to identify crime clusters.
#### Correlation Analysis:
Examined the relationship between crime rates, COVID-19 cases, and socioeconomic factors such as population density and deprivation.

## Key Results

Property Crimes: Significant declines in burglary and theft, especially during strict lockdown periods.
Domestic Violence: Notable increase in domestic violence incidents, particularly during the early stages of the pandemic.
Geographic Variability: Crime trends varied across boroughs, influenced by local socioeconomic conditions.
